Only a basic test to parse the backup xml file from clavister fierwall.
Needs a file path added and wiht Beutifulsoup it ignors the problems in the xml file
DO note that it might need a backup file that has been edited and the 1st line in the XML file might need to be removed.
I take no resposability for use of this program in any way.
It might work and it might break things.
It uses the folloing 
Pandas https://pandas.pydata.org/ 
for data transformation to cvs file
https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
To read in the base file.
Big thanks to the developers of that !!!
